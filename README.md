# 201 Guessing Game

Hopefully my code doesn't remind you of a hostage situation! Thanks for your help and kindly worded grading.

Student: I don’t understand why my grade was so low. How did  I do on my research paper?

Teacher: Actually, you didn’t turn in a research paper. You turned in a random assemblage of sentences. 
In fact, the  sentences you apparently  kidnapped in the dead of night  and forced into this violent and arbitrary 
plan of yours clearly seemed to be placed on the pages against their will. Reading your paper was like watching 
unfamiliar, uncomfortable people interacting at a cocktail party that no one wanted to attend in the first place. 
You didn’t submit a research paper. You submitted a hostage situation.
